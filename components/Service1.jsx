      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Trial Pits Exploration</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Geotechnical investigations often begin with trial pits exploration, an essential initial step. This process involves excavating small pits at specific locations on a site to gather valuable information about the subsurface conditions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The collected data is crucial for site characterization, geological mapping, and risk assessment. Trial pits allow us to document soil layers, their depths, and any anomalies.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We prioritize safety during excavation and follow environmental regulations to ensure responsible geotechnical investigations. Our detailed approach to trial pits exploration ensures a solid foundation for project planning and construction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Drilling in All Types of Soil and Rock (L&M)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our geotechnical team specializes in drilling techniques suitable for a wide range of soil and rock conditions.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Undisturbed Sampling (L&M)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Undisturbed sampling is a precise and meticulous process used to extract soil samples without altering their natural state. This method is particularly crucial when working with cohesive soils like clays, where preserving the soil's integrity is paramount for accurate testing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Standard Penetration Test (L&M)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a widely recognized method used to assess the properties of soil at various depths. During the SPT, a sample tube is driven into the ground, and the number of blows required to drive the tube a specified distance is recorded. This number, known as the SPT N-value, provides information about the soil's resistance to penetration, which is crucial for foundation design and settlement analysis.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Cone Penetration Test (L&M)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Cone Penetration Test (CPT) is another method used for soil investigation. It involves pushing a cone-shaped penetrometer into the ground at a constant rate while measuring resistance. The data collected from the CPT provides insights into the soil's properties, including its bearing capacity, shear strength, and stratigraphy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Field CBR (California Bearing Ratio)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Field California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test assesses the strength of the soil subgrade. It involves measuring the pressure required to penetrate a soil sample with a plunger under controlled conditions. The CBR value indicates the soil's ability to support loads, making it a vital parameter for pavement design and road construction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Field Permeability</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Field permeability testing is conducted to assess how easily water can flow through soil. It is a fundamental parameter in geotechnical engineering, as it affects groundwater flow and drainage. The test typically involves measuring the rate at which water passes through a soil sample under controlled conditions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Field Density</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Field density testing is essential for ensuring proper compaction of soil during construction. It involves measuring the density of compacted soil to determine if it meets specified standards. Proper compaction is critical for the stability of foundations, roadways, and embankments.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Plate Load Test</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Plate Load Test assesses the bearing capacity of the soil beneath a foundation or structure. It involves applying a known load to a plate placed on the ground's surface and measuring the settlement. The data collected is used to evaluate the soil's bearing capacity and its ability to support the anticipated loads.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Field Vane Shear Test</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Field Vane Shear Test is a method for measuring the shear strength of cohesive soils in their natural state. It involves inserting a vane into the ground and measuring the torque required to twist it. This test provides valuable data for evaluating slope stability, foundation design, and excavation safety.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Block Vibration Test</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Block Vibration Test evaluates the response of soil and structures to vibrations. It is particularly relevant in areas near heavy machinery, transportation routes, or seismic zones. The test involves applying controlled vibrations and measuring the soil and structure's dynamic response.
